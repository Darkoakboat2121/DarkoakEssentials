    secret items giver
    trails
    safe op:
        has special tools that emulate certain commands
        can fly
        breaks deny blocks near player and replaces blocks once away
        only do-admins can change player to safe op and back
        blocks do-admins from entering safe op
    auto-chest refill



chat:
    
    
anticheat:
    (toggle) detect if player has lots of valuable resources
    (toggle) detect if player is near command block minecart
    (dropdown) player picker [top option is empty] for hack test, uses /inputpermission then checks if player is still moving
    (toggle) adds unique id to every item than checks items for duped ids, therefore duped item


currently working on is below here

Plots are similar but build structures in a co-ord space. This will get a tutorial on youtube to explain how to use it.

IDEA NOTE: for the array things, use a var and a ++ iterator so you can just copy them for long settings
naman1141

IDEA NOTE: for things that constantly get data, delay each by 20 ticks for retrieval

IDEA NOTE: "minecraft:entity_created" listen for this event, might use component system idk, datadrivenentitytrigger?

i do have some ideas to improve them though:
an area option for gens (fill)
adding them to the roles editor (so you can give roles permission to break the certain gens)

M IDEA: have a map in defaults file that has all the dynamic properties, then just retrieve them from that, when updating a property set map and dynamic property
