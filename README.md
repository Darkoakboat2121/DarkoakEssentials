Land claims and plots:
Land claim button in community item that allows a player to claim up to 4 chunks (probably customizable). Claimed areas will only be breakable and buildable by players allowed by the owner.

Plots are similar but build structures in a co-ord space. This will get a tutorial on youtube to explain how to use it.
