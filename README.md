This Minecraft bedrock addon is an essentials addon. Please credit me if you're going to use the code.

Plans:

community:
    auction house
    player shop
    plots
    item trading

tracking:
    blocks broken
    blocks placed
    minutes played
    deaths
    kills

other:
    sitting
    secret items giver
    trails
    safe op:
        has special tools that emulate certain commands
        can fly
        breaks deny blocks near player and replaces blocks once away
        only do-admins can change player to safe op and back
        blocks do-admins from entering safe op
    auto-chest refill



chat:
    
    
anticheat:
    (toggle) detect if player has lots of valuable resources
    (toggle) detect if player is near command block minecart
    (dropdown) player picker [top option is empty] for hack test, uses /inputpermission then checks if player is still moving
    (toggle) adds unique id to every item than checks items for duped ids, therefore duped item


currently working on is below here

Plots are similar but build structures in a co-ord space. This will get a tutorial on youtube to explain how to use it.


* means todo
